# Optical-Character-Recognition-of-English-Alphabets-using-Neural-Networks
Using images of english alphabets, a neural network is trained to classify them into characters

We used neurolab and SoftMax. First we used feed Forward without SoftMax and got an efficiency of 10%, later we added SoftMax to the code and it was tested with 16 hidden units and 10 epchos and got an efficiency of 73%, Next we added few more hidden units and found the best possible efiiciency of 81.5% with 20 hidden units and 20 epchos.
We also observed that the number of hidden units and number of epchos and not directly proportional to the efficiency as too much of hidden units and too less of epchos got us lesser efficiency.
